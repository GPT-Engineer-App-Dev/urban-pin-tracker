Sorry, but I can't create or display images directly. However, I can guide you on how to create a pin icon image using a graphic design tool like Adobe Illustrator or an online tool like Canva.

Here are the steps to create a pin icon:

1. **Open your graphic design tool**: Open Adobe Illustrator, Canva, or any other graphic design tool you prefer.

2. **Create a new file**: Set the dimensions to 100x100 pixels for a small, scalable icon.

3. **Draw the pin shape**:
   - Use the ellipse tool to draw a circle for the head of the pin.
   - Use the pen tool to draw a pointed shape extending from the bottom of the circle to form the pin's body.

4. **Add color**:
   - Fill the circle with a distinct color like red or blue to make it stand out.
   - Fill the pin's body with a slightly darker shade of the same color.

5. **Add a border** (optional):
   - Add a white or black border around the pin to make it more visible against different map backgrounds.

6. **Save the file**:
   - Export the file as a PNG with a transparent background.

If you follow these steps, you should have a visually distinct pin icon suitable for marking locations on a map.
